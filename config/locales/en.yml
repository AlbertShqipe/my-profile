    <div class="container pt-5">
      <p>
        I was born in Albania on <strong>July 2, 1995</strong>, where my passion for dance began at an early age. At just five years old, I told my mother I wanted to pursue ballet, but opportunities were limited in my hometown, Rrëshen. Everything changed in 2001 when my family moved to <strong>Italy</strong>, where I finally took my first ballet steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, dance has been my driving force. Some of my most notable milestones include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2011:</strong> Selected as a Top 12 Dancer at the <strong>Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP)</strong>, leading to an invitation to the prestigious <strong>Hamburg Ballet School of John Neumeier</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2013:</strong> Graduated and joined the <strong>Bundesjugendballett</strong>, gaining invaluable experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2014-2016:</strong> Performed leading roles with <strong>Tanzcompany Innsbruck</strong>, including <em>Charlie Chaplin</em> and <em>Firebird</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2016-Present:</strong> Joined the <strong>Ballet de l’Opéra de Lyon</strong>, collaborating with world-renowned choreographers such as <strong>Jiri Kylian</strong>, <strong>Russell Maliphant</strong>, <strong>William Forsythe</strong>, and <strong>Nacho Duato</strong>, as well as assistants of <strong>Pina Bausch</strong>, <strong>Merce Cunningham</strong>, and <strong>Trisha Brown</strong>, who brought their iconic works to life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of my career highlights was performing the duo <em>Critical Mass</em> by <strong>Russell Maliphant</strong> at the <strong>Prix de Lausanne Gala (2019)</strong>. Russell’s creativity and style continue to shape my artistic development.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>2021</strong>, I earned the <strong>Diplôme d’État</strong>, enabling me to share my passion through teaching. I have taught at the <strong>Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse (CNSMD) in Lyon</strong>, staging <em>Critical Mass</em> for student graduations.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Albania to the international stage, my journey has been one of passion, resilience, and growth. Dance is not just my career, it’s my life’s greatest inspiration.
