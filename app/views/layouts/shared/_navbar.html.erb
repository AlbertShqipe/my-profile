          <p>The purpuse of this page is to share with everyone my work.</p>
          <p>My passion involves the language of mouvement, any type of creation process
            and the place that theaters hold in our society .
            <p>I was born in 1995 and started dancing at the age of eight, since then I never stopped practicing.</p>
            <p>During the years, first as a student and later as a professional dancer/interpreter, I got the chance to
              work with some of the most
              iconic and renowned choreographers and artists of the contemporary scene.</p>
            <p>This incredible travel gave me a lot of discipline and unforgettable experiences that I would like to
              share with you!</p>
            <p>In this moment, while I am writing this paragraph using the Rails framework, I am a software engineer
              while being a
              professianl dancer at the Ballet of the National Opera of Lyon in France.</p>
            <p>This website is my portfolio, including my artistical and academical work.</p>
          <p>Please enjoy and for any cooperation don't hesitate to contact me.
            You will find all the necessary information in the "contacts" section.</p>
